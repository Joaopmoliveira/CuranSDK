Curan is a medical toolkit written in C++ which simplifies integration with third-party dependecies and provides solutions for your custom medical needs. The library was developed in the context of the PhD thesis to test and showcase the potential of robotic applications in the medical field. Since then it has grown to provide a broader range of tools one can use to develop their desired applications.
