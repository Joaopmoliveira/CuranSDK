Curan is a medical toolkit written in C++ which simplifies integration with third-party dependecies and provides solutions for your custom medical needs. 

You can find the source code for Curan at GitHub:
[Curan](https://github.com/Human-Robotics-Lab/Curan/tree/main)

If you find that you don't have authorization to acess the github repository of Curan, ask one of the maintainers for acess to your personal account.

On with our adventure into programming. This is hopefully a detaild view of how to use and understand the project layout.

If you want to start on this path, read the [build intructions](/build_intructions/) on how to compile Curan in your personal machine. Currently we have only tested Curan in Windows and Ubunto, although most libraries should work out of the box in Mac OS. 

If you already have Curan installed in your machine, then take a look at some of the [tutorials](/tutorials/) we provide to guide you through the API of Curan.
