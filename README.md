This file described the Curan Library. The intent is to provide a general idea on how the library is constructed, how to use the building blocks supplied to 
create higher level abstraction until a fully usable UI with proper functioning is supplied. 

Curan is a medical viewer, developed by IST, with contribution from João Oliveira. We wish to develop a viewer which is smooth, easy to interact, with 
a lot of flexibility for the developers, intead of other viewers which severely restrict the potential of the developer. The main idea is to develop modules, 
which correspond to independent viewers. The application provides a main viewer, where we can then lauch other viewers, dedicated for each application
and the UI is tailor made for the particular application.
