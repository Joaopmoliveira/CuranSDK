# Curan

This file describes the Curan Library. The intent is to provide a general
idea on how the library is constructed, how to use the building blocks
supplied to create higher level abstraction until a fully usable UI with
proper functioning is supplied. 

Curan is a medical viewer, developed by IST, with contribution from
João Oliveira (more to come?). The library provides interfaces which
simplify the implementation of medical demos with real time
capabilities. 

The library is divided into four main modules
1. The utilities library contains base classes used by all other modules,
such as thread safe queues, blocks used to connect objects, memory buffers
which can usurp the ownbership of shared pointers, etc..
2. The communication library supplies higher level abstractions over asio which
allow us to lauch an application with a indifinite number of clients, with any protocol.
Currently only the OpenIGTlink protocol is implemented in the library. More protocols
can be added at will without any effort.
3. The userinferface library contains higher level abstractions over the Skia library
to render 2D entities in real time.
