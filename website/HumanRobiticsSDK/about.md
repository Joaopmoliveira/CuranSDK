Curan is a medical toolkit written in C++ which simplifies integration with third-party dependecies and provides solutions for your custom medical needs. The library was developed in the context of a PhD thesis (from Jo√£o Oliveira) to test and showcase the potential of robotic applications in the medical field. Since then it has grown, thanks to contributions from students in their Master Thesis, to provide a broader range of tools one can use to develop their desired applications. 

Curan follows a philosofy of modularizing each application in its own separate process. This achieves two things, it allows us to debug and guarantee the quality of the application by itself, and it simplifies the learning curve for students trying to develop their own tools. Instead of having to look at a massive code base, with details which are unecessary for their use case, through this modularization we are able to reduce the amount of code students need to look at.
