The libraries contained in Curan are:

# Comunication

Contains a generic interface of servers and clients to communicate between each other. This interface can be updated to decode and encode any protocol, by using the std::variant interface to add new behavior.

# Gaussianmixtures

Contains the implementation of Gaussian Mixture Regression to be used with the robot controller

# ImageProcessing



# Optimization

The optimization interface contains algorithm used to solve calibration algorithms. Currently it only has algorithm to solve the pose calibration problem with the robotic system. 

# Realtime Kernel

# Rendering

The rendering library contains wrapper to render the robotic system, volumes, signals in real time. 

# Robotutils

The robotutils library is used 

# UserInterface
